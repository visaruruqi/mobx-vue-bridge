## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-01

### ‚ú® New Features

#### Added `deep` configuration option for sync/async mutation modes
- **Feature**: New `deep: 'async' | 'sync'` configuration option to control nested mutation synchronization behavior
- **Default**: `'async'` (safe, prevents array corruption)
- **Usage**: `useMobxBridge(presenter, { deep: 'async' })` or `{ deep: 'sync' }`
- **Benefits**: 
  - Async mode (default): Data correctness guaranteed, all array methods work perfectly
  - Sync mode: Immediate synchronous access (legacy behavior), but arrays may corrupt
- **Recommendation**: Use async mode (default) with Presenter pattern = all logic in MobX side = always synchronous
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guide in README.md with examples, trade-offs, and best practices
- **Tests**: 11 new tests in `mobxVueBridgeSyncAsyncModes.test.js` covering both modes
- **Total Test Count**: 152 tests passing (141 original + 11 new)

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Fixed array mutation corruption with queueMicrotask batching
- **Issue**: Array methods like `shift()`, `unshift()`, and `splice()` were corrupting arrays during nested mutations. For example, `shift()` on `[1,2,3]` would produce `[2,2,3]` instead of `[2,3]`
- **Root Cause**: Each index assignment during array operations triggered an immediate `clone()` + sync, interrupting the in-progress array method
- **Impact**: Array mutations through nested proxies produced incorrect results, breaking data integrity
- **Fix**: Implemented `queueMicrotask()` batching in `createDeepProxy` to defer updates until array operations complete. Uses `updatePending` flag to batch multiple mutations into a single update. Made configurable via `deep` option
- **Location**: Line ~230-280 in `createDeepProxy` function
- **Side Effect**: Nested mutations are now async by default (microtask delay). Users should use `await nextTick()` from Vue if immediate access to updated values is needed in the same function
- **Result**: All array methods now work correctly without corruption in async mode (default)

#### Fixed `updatingFromVue` guard implementation
- **Issue**: The `updatingFromVue` Set was declared but never populated, making it a dead guard that didn't prevent potential echo loops
- **Impact**: Potential for echo loops in edge cases with custom objects or special equality scenarios
- **Fix**: Properly implemented the guard by wrapping all Vue ‚Üí MobX write operations with `updatingFromVue.add(prop)` and `updatingFromVue.delete(prop)` in try/finally blocks
- **Locations**: Property setters (line ~224), nested proxy setters (line ~195), getter/setter pairs (line ~253), and setter-only properties (line ~310)
- **Result**: Double protection against loops - primary via `isEqual` checks, secondary via `updatingFromVue` guard

#### Fixed nested proxy respecting `allowDirectMutation` flag
- **Issue**: When `allowDirectMutation: false` was set, top-level mutations were correctly blocked, but nested mutations (e.g., `state.user.name = 'Alice'` or `state.todos.push(item)`) bypassed the configuration and succeeded
- **Impact**: Configuration inconsistency - users couldn't enforce action-only mutation patterns for nested data
- **Fix**: Added `allowDirectMutation` check at the top of the `createDeepProxy` set trap, with proper warning messages including the full nested path (e.g., `"Direct mutation of 'user.name' is disabled"`)
- **Location**: Line ~182 in `createDeepProxy` function
- **Result**: The `allowDirectMutation` flag now consistently applies to all nesting levels

#### Added parameter validation for `mobxObject`
- **Issue**: No validation on the first parameter, leading to cryptic errors if users passed `null`, `undefined`, or non-objects
- **Impact**: Poor developer experience with unclear error messages deep in the code
- **Fix**: Added validation at function entry that throws a clear error: `"useMobxBridge requires a valid MobX observable object as the first parameter"`
- **Location**: Line ~15, immediately after function declaration
- **Result**: Fail-fast behavior with actionable error messages

#### Fixed circular reference handling in `isEqual`
- **Issue**: The deep equality function could enter infinite recursion when comparing objects with shared references or circular structures
- **Impact**: Stack overflow errors when working with complex data structures like tree nodes, graphs, or objects with bidirectional relationships
- **Fix**: Added `WeakSet` to track visited objects during comparison, preventing infinite recursion while maintaining proper garbage collection
- **Location**: Line ~135 in `isEqual` function
- **Result**: Can safely compare objects with shared references, deeply nested structures (100+ levels), and graph-like data

### ‚úÖ Testing
- Added 14 new tests (7 for validation, 7 for circular references)
- Updated existing tests to handle async nested mutations with `nextTick()`
- All 141 tests passing (127 original + 14 new)
- No breaking changes to public API
- Backward compatible with existing code

### üìù Documentation
- Updated README with async behavior notes for nested mutations
- Added example showing `nextTick()` usage for immediate value access
- Updated inline code comments for clarity
- Added JSDoc comments for better IDE integration

---

**Upgrade recommendation**: Recommended for all users. Especially important for:
- Users using `allowDirectMutation: false` with nested data
- Applications with complex object graphs or shared references
- Teams seeking better error messages for debugging
