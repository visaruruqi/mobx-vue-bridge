## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-01

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Fixed `updatingFromVue` guard implementation
- **Issue**: The `updatingFromVue` Set was declared but never populated, making it a dead guard that didn't prevent potential echo loops
- **Impact**: Potential for echo loops in edge cases with custom objects or special equality scenarios
- **Fix**: Properly implemented the guard by wrapping all Vue ‚Üí MobX write operations with `updatingFromVue.add(prop)` and `updatingFromVue.delete(prop)` in try/finally blocks
- **Locations**: Property setters (line ~224), nested proxy setters (line ~195), getter/setter pairs (line ~253), and setter-only properties (line ~310)
- **Result**: Double protection against loops - primary via `isEqual` checks, secondary via `updatingFromVue` guard

#### Fixed nested proxy respecting `allowDirectMutation` flag
- **Issue**: When `allowDirectMutation: false` was set, top-level mutations were correctly blocked, but nested mutations (e.g., `state.user.name = 'Alice'` or `state.todos.push(item)`) bypassed the configuration and succeeded
- **Impact**: Configuration inconsistency - users couldn't enforce action-only mutation patterns for nested data
- **Fix**: Added `allowDirectMutation` check at the top of the `createDeepProxy` set trap, with proper warning messages including the full nested path (e.g., `"Direct mutation of 'user.name' is disabled"`)
- **Location**: Line ~182 in `createDeepProxy` function
- **Result**: The `allowDirectMutation` flag now consistently applies to all nesting levels

#### Added parameter validation for `mobxObject`
- **Issue**: No validation on the first parameter, leading to cryptic errors if users passed `null`, `undefined`, or non-objects
- **Impact**: Poor developer experience with unclear error messages deep in the code
- **Fix**: Added validation at function entry that throws a clear error: `"useMobxBridge requires a valid MobX observable object as the first parameter"`
- **Location**: Line ~15, immediately after function declaration
- **Result**: Fail-fast behavior with actionable error messages

#### Fixed circular reference handling in `isEqual`
- **Issue**: The deep equality function could enter infinite recursion when comparing objects with shared references or circular structures
- **Impact**: Stack overflow errors when working with complex data structures like tree nodes, graphs, or objects with bidirectional relationships
- **Fix**: Added `WeakSet` to track visited objects during comparison, preventing infinite recursion while maintaining proper garbage collection
- **Location**: Line ~135 in `isEqual` function
- **Result**: Can safely compare objects with shared references, deeply nested structures (100+ levels), and graph-like data

### ‚úÖ Testing
- Added 14 new tests (7 for validation, 7 for circular references)
- All 134 tests passing (120 original + 14 new)
- No breaking changes to public API
- Backward compatible with existing code

### üìù Documentation
- Updated inline code comments for clarity
- Added JSDoc comments for better IDE integration

---

**Upgrade recommendation**: Recommended for all users. Especially important for:
- Users using `allowDirectMutation: false` with nested data
- Applications with complex object graphs or shared references
- Teams seeking better error messages for debugging
